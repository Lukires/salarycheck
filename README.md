This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The intention of this project is to use https://www.dst.dk/da (Danish Statistics), to compare your own salary with the average danish citizen, based on some variables.

To setup the project:

## Clone
### `git clone`

## Install
### `yarn install`

## Start
### `yarn start`


If does not work, try using npm instead.
https://www.npmjs.com/

In which case you would use:
## Install
### `npm install`

## Start
### `npm start`



If it didn't open by itself, go to [http://localhost:3000] to view the webside once you've started it.
